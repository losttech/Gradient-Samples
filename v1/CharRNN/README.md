# CharRNN sample is not supported on TensorFlow 2.x

The original code required layers from `tf.contrib`, which were removed in TensorFlow 2.x.

You can still view the sample for TensorFlow 1.15 in the
[corresponding branch](https://github.com/losttech/Gradient-Samples/tree/v1.15/CharRNN).

If you have a clone of this repository, you can simply `git checkout v1.15`.
